        How to use your new lamp
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Wtf is this?
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is your new lamp of course :D You can control it from your phone, your laptop, or anything else with a web
        browser really. You'll also have some iOS shortcuts you can use to control some features too.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Alright, what does everything do?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Good question! I'll start with an overview, and then dive into each mode if you're interested.
    </p>
    <h3>
        An overview
    </h3>
    <p>
        The lamp has six modes: Manual, Breathe, Chaser, Flow, Ember and Notify (somewhat obscure names I know). You can switch between them at any time by going back to <a href="http://lamp.local/"> the main site</a> and pressing the menu button, then pressing one of the buttons on the left that pop out. For some features to work, you'll have to leave it in a specific mode (I'll get into details in the next sections). If you want to automate things, let me know because it is built with the capability to do that easily. Changing colours in Manual, Breathe, Chaser and Ember will save between restarts and mode changes, and they share the colour you pick for them. Notify, on the other hand has its own colours.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Manual
    </h3>
    <p>
        Pretty much does what it says on the tin. You can set solid colours. Leave it in this mode for shortcuts that set solid colours. Woo, one down.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Breathe
    </h3>
    <p>
        Same thing as Manual, but the brightness ~B R E A T H E S~ - you can use this for the same shortcuts as Manual if you want them to breathe. Oh, and you can set the speed it breathes at.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Chaser
    </h3>
    <p>
        The colour you set will run up and down the lamp at the speed you set. Simple as that. Again, you can use it with the same shortcuts as manual and breathe if you want the colours to go up and down.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Flow
    </h3>
    <p>
        &#127752 All you can do here is set the speed, and taste the rainbow. You can't leave it in this mode if you want to use shortcuts. This one is vibey.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Ember
    </h3>
    <p>
        The intention behind this was to simulate fire kind of. Similar to Breathe and Chaser, you can set the speed and colour and it will work with shortcuts.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Notify
    </h3>
    <p>
        Ah yes, I made this one specially for you. When left on and used in conjuction with the automation shortcut I can help you set up, the lamp will continuously blink after getting an event happening on your phone. This has its own colours, which you can change yourself from the menu, and press the button under the sliders to test. The default colour is my go at making cream - what you said was the colour you associate with Dasha's voice - because my intention was initially to make it blink when she texted you, however after implementing this I discovered iOS doesn't let me do that properly, so instead we'll make it blink while you're texting her, so its sort of like having her voice there I guess. If you'd like something else though I'm happy to do that instead and show you how to change it yourself. Other shortcuts won't work with this one.
    </p>

        The End

        I hope you enjoy your present Ibbi &#60;3, sorry to give you your billionth D&D themed present, but I just thought the dice went so well with this.
